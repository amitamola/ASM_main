# Analysis of Gene Expression Cancer Data

Brief description of different files used in this project:

### 1. EDA on Chowdary data.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains the code for exploratory data analysis on the Chowdary data. 

### 2. Fitting Lasso model.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for fitting a Logistic Regression with Lasso penalty on the Chowdary data. It uses L1 regularization technique to select the most important features.

### 3. Fitting Elastic Net Model.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for fitting an Elastic Net model on the Chowdary data. It uses a combination of L1 and L2 regularization techniques.

### 4. Random Forest.ipynb
Code for fitting a Random Forest model on the data.

### 5. PCA + Logistic.ipynb
Code for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and fitting a Simple Logistic Regression model without any penalty.

### 6. Dimensionality Reduction tryout notebook(Optional).ipynb *(optional)*
This Jupyter notebook contains the code for trying out various dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP on the Chowdary data.

### 7. Trying XGBoost.ipynb *(optional)*
This Jupyter notebook contains the code for fitting an XGBoost model on the Chowdary data.
